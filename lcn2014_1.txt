# The SparseVals (technically, lambda) determine the overall sparsity
# penalty. This penalty is minimized by selecting as few voxels as possible.
# In conjunction with the Group sparsity penalty, the result will be a sparse
# selection of voxels that have a similar structure across subjects.

# There are 3 implemented cross validation methods.

CrossValidationMethod: kfold

# The data are split into 3 layers: input, hidden, and output. 
# They each have a particular structure, and are intended to demonstrate
# different things. We can add arbitrary voxels (i.e. columns of i.i.d.
# Gaussian noise) to the data to make recovering the signal more difficult.
# This really shouldn't effect much unless we also shuffle.
# You should provide 3 integer values, separated by spaces. For the most part,
# we care about manipulating the hidden layer, so typically the first and 
# third value will be zero. Position 1, 2, and 3 are Input, Hidden, and Output,
# respectively.

# Shuffle by layer lets you specify which layers should be shuffled
# (so that informative voxels are no longer neighbors). You should provide
# 3 binary values (0 or 1), where 1 means "shuffle this layer". There are 
# two shuffle methods: interleave and permute. Permute shuffles randomly;
# interleave maximizes the distance between informative voxels.

# Group size and group shift have to do with how voxels are considered similar
# within and across subjects. Group size of 5 and shift of 2 will group voxels
# [1 2 3 4 5] in group 1 and [3 4 5 6 7] in group 2. Often, a group shift of about
# half the group size is reasonable. But, odd numbered group sizes are allowed. If
# you provide a + instead of a number, GroupShift = GroupSize-(GroupSize//2), i.e.,
# divide by two using integer division and round up. If you provide a -, 
# GroupShift = GroupSize//2, i.e., divide by two using integer division (which effectively
# rounds down).
# tl;dr: GroupShift + means ceiling(GroupSize/2); GroupShift - means floor(GroupSize/2).
